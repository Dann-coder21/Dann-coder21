🚀 About Me
I'm a final-year student of Mathematics & Computer Science, poised to graduate in 2025, and a dedicated software developer with a strong foundation in building scalable and secure web applications. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create practical, user-centric solutions for real-world problems.

🔭 I’m currently working as a Software Developer at Auxica Africa, building a secure Hospital Management System with C#, .NET, PostgreSQL, and Azure.

🌱 I’m continuously expanding my cloud knowledge with ongoing training in Google Cloud Platform.

💼 My previous experience includes an ICT Support role at Strathmore University, which honed my technical problem-solving and client-support skills.

💡 I'm interested in Backend Development, Cloud Architecture, and Clean Code.
